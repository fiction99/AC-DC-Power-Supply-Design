# AC-DC-Power-Supply-Design
This document is broken up into two distinct portions, one is a research report wherein the goal was to design a regulated AC-DC Zener diode based power supply that minimizes output ripple voltage and have the AC Vripple < 10 mV, providing 100mA into the load. The design was constructed and tested in laboratory and using SPICE simulation software. The other is a physical project wherein the goal was to design a fixed and variable voltage linear power supply with AAA Li-On battery charging capability. This design was constructed external to laboratory and implemented via trial and error. Both are docuemnted below.
